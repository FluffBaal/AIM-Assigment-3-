# RAG Chat Application Development Plan

## Project Overview
A modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat application that allows users to upload PDFs and chat with them using GPT-4.1-mini.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Dependency Management**: UV (Python), npm (JavaScript)
- **LLM**: GPT-4.1-mini via OpenAI API
- **RAG Library**: aimakerspace (existing in backend folder)
- **Vector Store**: In-memory (aimakerspace VectorDatabase)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend & Backend)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure âœ…
**Branch**: `feature/project-setup`
- [x] Install UV dependency manager
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies
- [x] Create .gitignore and .env.example
- [x] Initialize backend FastAPI structure
- [ ] Initialize React + TypeScript frontend with Vite
- [ ] Configure Vercel deployment files
- [ ] Set up development scripts

### Phase 2: Backend API Development
**Branch**: `feature/backend-api`
- [ ] Create FastAPI routers structure
- [ ] Implement API key validation middleware
- [ ] Create PDF upload endpoint with validation
- [ ] Implement PDF indexing using aimakerspace
- [ ] Create chat endpoint with streaming support
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Create Vercel serverless function configuration

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
**Branch**: `feature/frontend-ui`
- [ ] Set up React project with Vite and TypeScript
- [ ] Create component structure
- [ ] Build API key input modal
- [ ] Implement PDF upload with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Create chat interface with message history
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Implement responsive design

### Phase 4: RAG Integration
**Branch**: `feature/rag-integration`
- [ ] Connect PDF processing to vector database
- [ ] Implement retrieval logic with metadata
- [ ] Add chunk source tracking
- [ ] Integrate chat with RAG context
- [ ] Display source citations in UI
- [ ] Optimize chunk size and retrieval

### Phase 5: Vercel Deployment Setup
**Branch**: `feature/vercel-deployment`
- [ ] Create vercel.json for backend API
- [ ] Configure frontend deployment settings
- [ ] Set up environment variables in Vercel
- [ ] Create build scripts for production
- [ ] Configure CORS for production domains
- [ ] Set up custom domain (if needed)

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
**Branch**: `feature/testing-docs`
- [ ] Add unit tests for backend endpoints
- [ ] Add integration tests for RAG flow
- [ ] Create frontend component tests
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Add deployment documentation

### Phase 7: Production Optimization
**Branch**: `feature/production-ready`
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add request validation
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Implement error tracking
- [ ] Performance optimization

## PR Strategy
1. Each phase will be developed in its own feature branch
2. PRs will be created against the main branch
3. Each PR will include:
   - Detailed description of changes
   - Testing instructions
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)
   - Deployment notes
4. Code review checklist:
   - Code follows project conventions
   - Tests are included
   - Documentation is updated
   - No secrets in code
   - Vercel deployment successful

## Vercel Deployment Architecture

### Backend (Serverless Functions)
- FastAPI app deployed as Vercel Python Runtime
- API routes exposed at `/api/*`
- Environment variables managed through Vercel dashboard

### Frontend (Static Site)
- React app built with Vite
- Deployed as static assets
- API calls proxied to backend functions

### Configuration Files
- `vercel.json` for routing and build settings
- `.vercelignore` for deployment exclusions
- Environment variables for API keys

## Security Considerations
- API keys never committed to code
- User-provided OpenAI keys stored client-side only
- File upload validation and size limits
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
