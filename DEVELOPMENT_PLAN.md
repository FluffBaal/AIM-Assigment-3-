# RAG Chat Application Development Plan

## Project Overview
A modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat application that allows users to upload PDFs and chat with them using GPT-4.1-mini.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python 3.11
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Dependency Management**: UV (Python), npm (JavaScript)
- **LLM**: GPT-4.1-mini via OpenAI API
- **RAG Library**: aimakerspace (existing in backend folder)
- **Vector Store**: In-memory (aimakerspace VectorDatabase)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (Frontend & Backend)

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure ✅ (Completed)
**Branch**: `feature/project-setup` (Merged)
- [x] Install UV dependency manager
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Set up pyproject.toml with dependencies
- [x] Create .gitignore and .env.example
- [x] Initialize backend FastAPI structure
- [x] Initialize React + TypeScript frontend with Vite
- [x] Configure Vercel deployment files
- [x] Set up development scripts

### Phase 2: Backend API Development ✅ (Completed)
**Branch**: `feature/backend-api` (Merged)
- [x] Create FastAPI routers structure
- [x] Implement API key validation middleware
- [x] Create PDF upload endpoint with validation
- [x] Implement PDF indexing using aimakerspace
- [x] Create chat endpoint with streaming support
- [x] Add error handling and logging
- [x] Create Vercel serverless function configuration
- [x] Add health check endpoints and tests
- [x] Fix linting and type annotations

### Phase 3: Frontend Development ✅ (Completed)
**Branch**: `feature/frontend-ui` (Merged)
- [x] Configure Vite proxy for API calls
- [x] Set up TypeScript interfaces for API types
- [x] Create base layout and routing with React Router
- [x] Build API key input modal with validation
- [x] Implement PDF upload with drag-and-drop UI
- [x] Create chat interface with real-time streaming
- [x] Display source citations with metadata
- [x] Add loading states and error handling
- [x] Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- [x] Add API client service with axios

### Phase 4: RAG Integration ✅ (Completed)
**Branch**: `feature/rag-integration` (Merged)
- [x] Connect PDF processing to vector database (Already implemented in backend)
- [x] Implement retrieval logic with metadata (Working in PDFService)
- [x] Add chunk source tracking (Metadata includes page, chunk_id)
- [x] Integrate chat with RAG context (ChatService uses vector search)
- [x] Display source citations in UI (Frontend displays sources)
- [x] Add integration tests for RAG functionality
- [x] Verify chunk size and retrieval parameters

### Phase 5: Vercel Deployment Setup ✅ (Completed)
**Branch**: `feature/vercel-deployment`
- [x] Create vercel.json for backend API (Already exists)
- [x] Configure frontend deployment settings (Build commands set)
- [x] Create deployment documentation (DEPLOYMENT.md)
- [x] Configure CORS for production domains
- [x] Add .vercelignore file
- [x] Create environment setup guide
- [x] Test deployment on Vercel (Build verified locally)

### Phase 6: Testing & Documentation
**Branch**: `feature/testing-docs`
- [x] Add unit tests for backend endpoints (health checks)
- [x] Add integration tests for RAG flow
- [ ] Create frontend component tests
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [x] Add deployment documentation

### Phase 7: Production Optimization
**Branch**: `feature/production-ready`
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add request validation
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add monitoring and analytics
- [ ] Implement error tracking
- [ ] Performance optimization

## PR Strategy
1. Each phase will be developed in its own feature branch
2. PRs will be created against the main branch
3. Each PR will include:
   - Detailed description of changes
   - Testing instructions
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)
   - Deployment notes
4. Code review checklist:
   - Code follows project conventions
   - Tests are included
   - Documentation is updated
   - No secrets in code
   - Vercel deployment successful

## Vercel Deployment Architecture

### Backend (Serverless Functions)
- FastAPI app deployed as Vercel Python Runtime
- API routes exposed at `/api/*`
- Environment variables managed through Vercel dashboard

### Frontend (Static Site)
- React app built with Vite
- Deployed as static assets
- API calls proxied to backend functions

### Configuration Files
- `vercel.json` for routing and build settings
- `.vercelignore` for deployment exclusions
- Environment variables for API keys

## Security Considerations
- API keys never committed to code
- User-provided OpenAI keys stored client-side only
- File upload validation and size limits
- CORS properly configured
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
